We returned back to Hobart and wandered around the city in the afternoon. It was interesting to see what has changed and what has remained the same. We have a great dinner at Mr. Good Guy and we went for the &#8220;Trust Mr. Good Guy&#8221; surprise banquet option and it was absolutely fabulous &#8211; there was so much food we simply could not finish it all!
