PHAROS is less of a museum and more a theme park of ideas and installations.

Some of the things I liked here include

- 20:50 (Richard Wilson) &#8211; basically a chamber filled with motor oil
- Memorial to the Sacred Wind, or the Tomb of a Kamikaze (Jean Tinguely)
- Beside Myself (James Turrell)
- Event Horizon (James Turrell)
- Grotto (Randy Polumbo)
- Lincoln (Nam Jun Park)
