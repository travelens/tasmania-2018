Funded by David Walsh, an eccentric and colourful Australian who made his fortune from devising a system for gambling and then spent a part of it on building a large and eclectic art collection, the museum grew out of a collection attached to the Moorilla Gallery to a large sprawling attraction in it&#8217;s own right.

We arrived at the museum just before they opened at 10am and there were no problems finding parking. We then waited for the museum to open. The following shots are taken outside the museum before opening.
