When we first visited Tasmania many years ago (on our honeymoon) we did the full Wineglass Bay and Hazards Beach circuit which takes more than half a day (we even saw a wombat on the route!) Of course we are much older now and I am still recovering from my sore tendon so we opted to just do the&nbsp;[Wineglass Bay lookout walk][1] which takes us from the carpark to a&nbsp;short, fairly steep climb to the saddle between Mt Amos and Mt Mayson. Here there is a beautiful view of Coles Bay and today was quite a hazy day which gave an orange almost sunset like glow to the sky. We also encountered a Singaporean travel documentary crew doing some filming.

From the saddle, we then climbed to the lookout, with spectacular views over Wineglass Bay. It was quite crowded at the lookout with lots of tourists trying to take photos. On the way down, we went by an alternate route back to the carpark.
