Today is our last day in Tasmania as we were booked to fly back to Sydney at 12:45. I wandered down to St. David&#8217;s Park, then explored Salamanca Market, then wandered though Parliament Square and Franklin Square before heading back to the hotel to check out. Luckily it started drizzling just as soon as I arrived back at the hotel so I was lucky. With sadness, we bade Hobart and Tasmania and fond farewell and another fantastic trip to the Apple Island.
