PHAROS is less of a museum and more a theme park of ideas and installations.

Some of the things I liked here include

  * 20:50 (Richard Wilson) &#8211; basically a chamber filled with motor oil
  * Memorial to the Sacred Wind, or the Tomb of a Kamikaze (Jean Tinguely)
  * Beside Myself (James Turrell)
  * Event Horizon (James Turrell)
  * Grotto (Randy Polumbo)
  * Lincoln (Nam Jun Park)
