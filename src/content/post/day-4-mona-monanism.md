The general collection in MONA tends to vary over time, but a few pieces really stood out for me. I didn&#8217;t really like the casts of vaginas (not because I was offended, but it wasn&#8217;t very interesting), but I found the following memorable:

  * _bit.fall_ (Julius Popp) &#8211; words from falling water droplets
  * _Kryptos_ (Brigita Ozolins) &#8211; a dark maze with binary codes on the walls
  * _Artifact_ (Gregory Barsamian) &#8211; rotorscope animation inside a large sculpture of a human head
  * _Snake_ (Sidney Nolan) &#8211; a giant curving wall of photos
  * _Mummy and Coffin of Pausiris_ &#8211; a dark tomb with steps above water that reminds me of a scene from Blade Runner 2049
  * _When My Heart Stops Beating_ (Patrick Hall) &#8211; deconstructed vinyl records
  * _The Blind Leading the Blind_, (Peter Buggenhout)
