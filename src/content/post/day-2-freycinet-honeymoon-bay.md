Honeymoon Bay is situated right next to the Freycinet Lodge and therefore we went in the evening as our last stop for the day. I wasn&#8217;t expecting much as it is not well publicised even on the National Parks website but it was surprisingly tranquil and beautiful especially in the orange hues of the late afternoon. There is a huge granite rock prominently situated on the beach and looks like it was thrown there by a baby giant.
