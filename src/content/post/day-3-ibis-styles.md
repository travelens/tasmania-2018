We finally made it to Hobart at close to 6pm, and checked into our hotel ([Ibis Styles][1]). This is a brand new budget hotel located in central Hobart, and surprisingly it looked at more swanky than I would have expected. The lobby was quite impressive and there is a modern Asian restaurant called Mr. Good Guy that we will check out tomorrow.
