This is an exhibition of various paintings, as well as the process itself, executed using a technique developed by Tim Jenison for creating photo-realistic paintings (or copies of famous paintings) using no more than a mirror on a stick.

Tim has used the technique to recreate&nbsp;_The Music Lesson_&nbsp;by Johannes Vermeer and invites visitors to the museum to try their hand at the technique.
