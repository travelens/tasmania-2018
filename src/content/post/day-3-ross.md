We stopped by [Ross][1] as the autumn leaves on the trees lining the main street (Church Street) were beautiful, and there are many historic building along the street. I had a scallop pie here, and then walked to the War Memorial before turning right and heading towards Ross Bridge. This is less well known than Richmond Bridge but almost as pretty.

The Ross Bakery is famous as the inspiration for the bakery in the Studio Ghibli animated feature &#8220;Kiki&#8217;s Delivery Service.&#8221;
